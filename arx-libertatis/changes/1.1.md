New Features:

* Linux: Merged the data install script and set it to be installed it with the arx binary
* Linux: Added a GUI to the data install script and launch it automatically if needed - you no longer need to use the terminal to install the game data under Linux!

* Linux: Fixed improper handling of set-but-empty $XDG_* variables
* Merged remaining fixes from Nuky's [arx-fatalis-fixed](https://code.google.com/archive/p/arx-fatalis-fixed/): (task #276)
  * Tweaked portrait render zone in the new game screen

Technical Changes:

* A **lot** of code cleanup
* Removed dependency on Boost.Program_options - Boost is now only needed at build-time. We tried to keep the same command-line argument syntax but there might be slight changes in corner cases. (task #353)
* Changed to always create a user/config directory in the user's in home directory unless explicitly changed with the `--user-dir` and/or `--config-dir` options or registry keys. Previously, if no data and user directories were found, the current working directory was used as the user directory.
* Linux: Added `/opt` as a system data directory prefix (besides `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`)
* Linux: Added `arx` as a system data directory suffix (besides `games/arx`)
* Added the executable directory as a system data directory (bug #242)
* Improved handling of bad UTF-8 sequences
* Made the text handling code architecture-independent
* Enabled C++11 mode for GNU-compatible compilers, if supported
* Added CMake options to control the custom compiler flags used
* Mac OS X: Fixed some build issues (YMMV)
* Fixed build with the Intel C++ compiler
* Fixed build with some MinGW32 distributions
* Fixed debug build with libc++
* Fixed build with CMake 2.8.10
* Fixed build with MS Visual Studio 2012
* Added support for building the crash reporter with Qt 5
* Aligned and tweaked log output
